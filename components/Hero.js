              Having mentors who can help direct and talk you through how to
              balance your time wisely makes a huge difference. Mentors can help
              ensure mentees are continuously learning over time and keeping
              skills relevant by sharing tips and valuable resources, and by
              making sure they understand itâ€™s impossible to know everything.
              All one can do is learn every day and keep your mind open and
              enjoy the process of taking on new challenges!

              We offer subscription-based support for one-on-one mentorship,
              enabling students to speak with mentors directly about any
              problems they are having. Additionally, mentors can provide
              students with a range of tech-related advice that can help them
              learn continuously and maintain their motivation as they study.
